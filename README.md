## People Clothing Multiclass Segmentation with U-Net Model
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive solution for tackling the challenging task of multiclass segmentation of people's clothing items in images,
leveraging the power of the U-Net architecture.
The objective of this project is to accurately delineate and classify various types of clothing worn by individuals in images, thus enabling a range of applications like fashion analysis, 
virtual fitting rooms, and innovative image-based shopping experiences.

The core of this repository centers around the implementation of the U-Net deep learning model, a proven architecture for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net's unique design combines contracting 
and expansive pathways to capture intricate details while retaining context, making it particularly suitable for pixel-level classification tasks. The repository provides a seamless workflow 
encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Model performnce metric
The model's performance is assessed using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU), reflecting its ability to accurately localize and classify clothing items.
